 <h2> In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do. </h2>

  <p> My name is Flavio Santino Pereira and I'm a Brazilian guy working as a Linux Technical Support Engineer for <a href="http://www.suse.com">SUSE Company</a>. I'm living in U.S, more specifically in Utah, since 2010 with my lovely wife. As a typical Brazilian, I love soccer but after 4 years living with this cold winter, I started to pratice snowboard and I really like it!<br></p>

  <p> Talking about my wife, I must say that she loves to cook and I hope this class would help me to improve her website - <a href="http://claudiasrecipe.blogspot.com"> Receita da Clau </a><br></p>
